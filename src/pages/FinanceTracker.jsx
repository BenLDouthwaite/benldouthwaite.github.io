            Project to create a personal finance tracker. 
        </p>
        <p>Requirements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Want to be able to track value of accounts.</li>
            <li>Should be able to visualise the value of accounts over time.</li>
            <li>Track individual transactions assigned to a specific budget.</li>
            <li>View Transactions per account.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Technical Considerations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Not intending to host this anywhere, it will be run purely on my own personal device, so security / hosting is less of a consideration.</li> 
            <li>As an exercise in design, the frontend should be usable in a debug mode with a mock backend and auto-generated test data, before creating the real backend</li> 
        </ul>
