For a long time, I wanted to start a 'portfolio' site.
I would often start one as a project, trying to build from scratch and enjoyably getting lost in the technology.
My goal here is to focus on the content, using technology to streamline this.

While this is my personal site, content will primarily cover:

- Programming
- Language study
- Music

Above all else, the goal is brevity and simplicity.
