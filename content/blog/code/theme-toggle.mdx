<ThemeTester />

What steps did I take, to log before writing up fully later:

- [x] Decide on the first pass color schemes for light / dark mode
  - Light: Plain white background with black text. Dark: Gray with blue hue, white / light gray text for fonts.
- [x] Build out a demo page, that shows somes of the components and styling.
  - [ ] Can I make one that takes any 'children' as input, and renders a list of themes, either horizontally or vertically
  - [x] Can use gatsby 'hello-friend' as a reference
- [x] Build a button on the nav bar, to toggle the applied themes.
- [x] Apply global theme override for background and colours
  - [ ] Need to figure out syntax to be applied for each sub components.
- [ ] Possibly need to override the build to allow SASS for css pre-processing
- [ ] On home page, fix on-hover colours and processing.
- [ ] Fix table header highlighting
- [ ] Review accent colours for the light / dark themes.
