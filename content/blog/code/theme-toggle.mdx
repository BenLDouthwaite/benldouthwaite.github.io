import ThemeTester from "../../../src/components/theme-tester"

What steps did I take, to log before writing up fully later:

- [ ] Decide on the color schemes / accent colours for light / dark mode
- [ ] Build out a demo page, that shows all the components and styling.
  - [ ] Can I make one that takes any 'children' as input, and renders a list of themes, either horizontally or vertically
  - [ ] Can use gatsby 'hello-friend' as a reference

<ThemeTester />
