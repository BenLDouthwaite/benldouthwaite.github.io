Things I'd like to research more, or would like to try a project with.
Ideally, I can keep this ordered, to pick from the top of the list when I have time.

# Priority Task List

- [ ] Any work that would not be professionally public facing, move to `reference` project
- [ ] Any pages that are unfinished, or mock content, delete
- [ ] Any dead links, delete
- [ ] Clear task-list and site-setup to single document. Add ability to flag as 'draft' to not appear on the site.

# Future improvement Ideas

- [ ] Tools summary page
- [ ] Calculator page needs the home page link in the nav bar
  - [ ] Add default reasonable values

## Blog Post Ideas

- [ ] Go web server + prometheus in k8s /
- [ ] Spring Boot + Prometheus + Grafana in local k8s
- [ ] Nginx + Prometheus + Grafana in local k8s

  - [ ] Enrich with Lua metrics
  - [ ] Try using 'openresty' images

- [ ] Building out some automation around my daily log / tasklist tools.
  - [ ] Create each file daily based on some cronjob, copying content from the most recent day, limit to 1 week
  - [ ] Auto-remove any completed tasks.
    - [ ] Remove subtasks from a parent task
    - [ ] Don't clear parent task unless all subtasks done.

## Books

- [ ] Cracking the coding Interview
- [ ] Clean code - read years ago, but good to review
- [ ] Designing data intensive applications
- [ ] Working effectively with legacy code
- Find a book for performance testing and improvements.

- [ ] Node
- [ ] React
  - [ ] React Native, bought a course at one point. Could be fun.
- [ ] Javascript, just as it is. I can use a review of the foundations.
- [ ] AWS
  - Started studying for the `AWS Certified Developer` last year, but stopped after moving jobs
- [ ] GCP
  - [ ] Research if there's a certification, or structured training course.
- [ ] CSS

- [ ] SEO
  - Currently, this site doesn't appear in Google results, it's something I've never looked into.
- [ ] Accessibility
  - How do I test for it?
  - For a blog, test with 'reader view' using Firefox, should be easily clear.
- [ ] Web Design
  - Specifically how to make pages actually look nice. Can mostly find pages I like and try to copy to learn.
