Things I'd like to research more, or would like to try a project with.
Ideally, I can keep this ordered, to pick from the top of the list when I have time.

## Technologies

- [ ] Gatsby
  - [ ] Connecting up with Cloud functions.
- [ ] GraphQL - Feeds into Gatsby
  - https://www.howtographql.com/
- [ ] Node
- [ ] React
  - [ ] React Native, bought a course at one point. Could be fun.
- [ ] Javascript, just as it is. I can use a review of the foundations.
- [ ] AWS
  - Started studying for the `AWS Certified Developer` last year, but stopped after moving jobs
- [ ] GCP
  - [ ] Research if there's a certification, or structured training course.
- [ ] CSS
  - [ ] SCSS
  - It's been a weak point for a long time.

## Concepts

- [ ] Security
  - https://tryhackme.com/
  - https://www.hackthebox.eu/
- [ ] SEO
  - Currently, this site doesn't appear in Google results, it's something I've never looked into.
- [ ] Accessibility
  - How do I test for it?
  - For a blog, test with 'reader view' using Firefox, should be easily clear.
- [ ] Web Design
  - Specifically how to make pages actually look nice. Can mostly find pages I like and try to copy to learn.
